# Booter
Well, this is an unfinished booter website made using Node.JS and React.JS
It is highly unoptimized and not completed, I do not recommend using it.
If you want to pick it and finish it off, please let me know!
## Main Idea / Objective
The main idea of this website is to faciliate pentesting.
You rent a private machine from **Booter**  and you will have to ability to do pretty much everything with it pentesting-related with just a click. (Without having the need to shell ofc)
## Features
Here's some of the features I implemented, there's more tho :
1. Ability to launch Denial of Service attacks with dynamic Layer 4 & Layer 7 method support.
2. Directory List scans with multiple wordlists.
3. Port Scan from range 1-1000.
4. GeoIP lookup using IPDB scraper and LeafletJS.
5. Game Server Lookup (players, map, etc...)
6. User-authentication system with super-user support.
7. A global shop for Servers, Methods, etc...  
8. Local funds system, can deposit using paypal-node-sdk
...

## TO-DO
There's a lot of TODO here, I can try to list some :
1. Meterpreter shell support in the web.
2. Change the way the server application connect to private machines from SSH or some sort of RESTLESS API or socket connect for better security & reliability.
3. Improve and fix current Directory Busting scan method and add the option to make it recursive & not-recursive.
4. Switch the current authentication method to JWT token or something.
5. Administration and Moderator panel
6. Redux for React.JS for better management and Next.JS for better performance
7. Use passport for authentication since everyone is doing it?
8. Run Dirbuster & Game Search & Port & GeoIP scans in the private machines of the user instead of server applications.
9. Add proxy support for Port & Dirbuster & Game Search scans for anonymity
10. Show what services running in said port.
11. Add a cloudflare resolver tool exploiting the misconfigured DNS settings 
12. Add a TOR screenshot tool
13. Optimize the current Frontend & Backend applications or maybe re-write them to some extent because that shit is so ugly I feel the urge to vomit every time I look at what I've done.
